# PSD-analysis

Final report for GOPH509 (Honor's program required), submitted to the Department of Geoscience, the University of Calgary

A written report based on independent study. Originality is emphasized.

Summary:

1. Developed a MATLAB program to generate PSD maps for recorded 3 component seismic data (~650 GB) in the Mount Meager area, BC, Canada

2. Identified the possible source of noise, that include fluid flow, helicopter, traffic on the road near the sites etc.

3. Compared seismic energy data (logarithmic PSD) with hydrometric data at the nearest water gauge.
